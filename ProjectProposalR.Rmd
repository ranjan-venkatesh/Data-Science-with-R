#**Title: Predictive Policing for EDA on Dallas Crime DataSet**

![](C:/Users/ASHISH SONI/Documents/Crimedataset/dallas-1.jpg)

##**Members**: 

* *R*anjan Venkatesh
* *A*lisha Mehta
* *A*shish Soni
* *S*hashikanth Sagunala

###**Background and Motivation**:

1. To assist the law enforcement in making certain helpful predictions      based on the heuristics of the past incidents.

2. Predictive insights help the law enforcement authorities to channel      their resources in the most effective way in order to curb potential     crimes.


###**Project Objectives**:

1. How days of the week and time of incident occurrence (morning/evening)    affect the crime rate?

2. What crimes are most common during evening?

3. How crimes vary within different neighborhood?

4. What percentage of crimes are “Hate crimes”? 

5. What age group in adults (over 18) is highly prone to be a victim?

6. What number of crime incidents that might occur given the location Zip    code, day of the week and time of occurence?


###**Name of the dataset**:

Dallas Open Data-Police Incidents

###**Design Overview**:

1. Data Cleaning : Includes resolving missing values or changing views

2. Data Preprocessing : Attribute mutations 

3. Data Analysis and Visualizations : Building models and getting           meaningful insights from the given dataset. Algorithms that are          planned for the implementation are as follows:
 + K-nearest neighbor 
 + Linear Regression
 + Naive Bayes (tentative)
 + Random Forest Regressor (tentative)
 + XGBoost (tentative)

4. Model Evaluation : Evaluate the models used, based on the confusion      matrix.
